            <p>A 31-year-old North California man accidentally shot himself in the right leg about 8 p.m. yesterday while looking for a hairy creature that allegedly dwells in the woods near Glacier Basin Campground in the Rockies.</p>
            <p>Carl T. Hockenson was admitted to Tierra Hospital with a .22-caliber bullet wound. Doctors say that the man lost a lot of blood, and was lucky to have arrived at the hospital in time. It appears that his wallet deflected the bullet just enough to miss the femoral artery. While the wallet is looking the worse for wear, the nurses say the man was in jovial spirits and is recovering quickly.</p>
            <p>Details of the shooting are sketchy, but police said Hockenson apparently was looking for the “beast” with friends when the weapon discharged.</p>

            <p>As many as 100 persons were in the vicinity late last night armed with various weapons and flashlights. All said they were looking for the creature.</p>
            <p>The search for the beast followed several days of reported—although not confirmed—sightings of a strange cat-like creature in Black Canyon and surrounding areas.</p>
            <p>The alleged beast has been described as between three and four feet tall, covered with hair and rumored to make a particular sound profile that seekers were tracking.</p>
            <p>Police emphasized that they have no confirmed reports of such a creature.</p>
